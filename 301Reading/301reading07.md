1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    - He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    - Because they weren't designed to be used like that. Most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    - HTTP tells the browser what protocol to use. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web.

4. What does a GET do?
    - GETs or  retrieves web page content.

5. What does a POST do?
    - POST adds something to another system.

6. What does PUT do?
    - PUT replaces something on another system.

7. What does PATCH do?
    - PATCH partially replaces something on another system.
