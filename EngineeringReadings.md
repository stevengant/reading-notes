# Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    I have always had a great work ethic and determination to get the job done. I have never liked leaving a task unfinished for the next day. If it is something that I am unable to complete before the end of the day, I make sure that I know exactly where I left off and what the next step is (organizational skills).


2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    - First and foremost is break the problem down into smaller bits that are more manageable.

    - Walk through the problem step by step to make sure I understand completely what is going on, what is supposed to be happening.

    - If I am unable to come up with a solution on my own, I will ask for help sooner. Maybe a fresh set of eyes will see something I missed.
