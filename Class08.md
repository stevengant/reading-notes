## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
    [web.dev - Wrapped flex lines](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)
    When the flex container wraps, it creates multiple flex lines. This is like adding another flex container. When a row is wrapped, it is not possible to allign with something above it.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    [web.dev - The main axis and the cross axis](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/#the-main-axis-and-the-cross-axis)
    The main axis is determined by the flex-direction (either row or column).
    The cross axis runs the opposite direction.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    [web.dev - Reversing the flow of items and accessibility](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/#reversing-the-flow-of-items-and-accessibility)
    Any changes that reorder the visual display can have negative impact on accessibility as screen readers order items visually.
