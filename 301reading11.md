1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL                       | NoSQL
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Relational Databases      | Non-relational/distributed
--------------------------------------------------------------
Table-based               | Doc-based - key-value pairs, etc
--------------------------------------------------------------
Predefined schema         | Dynamic schema
--------------------------------------------------------------
Vertically scalable       | Horizontally scalable
--------------------------------------------------------------
Use Structured Query Lang | Focused on collection of documents
--------------------------------------------------------------
 	 
 	 
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    Complex queries

2. Give a real world example.
    Querying a database of customers and their addresses.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    Large data sets

4. Give a real world example.
    "Brand":"Benz"
    "Max_Speed":250
    "Color":"Green"

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    NoSQL

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    SQL

1. What does SQL stand for?
    - Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?
    - A database that works with certain assumptions/in a certain way

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    - Tables

4. What is a ‘schema’?
    - Schema is defined by fields or table cells


5. What is a NoSQL database?
    - A database that is built to store large amounts of data in a very efficient way.

6. How does it work?
    - Stores documents within collections. Documents consist of key-value pairs

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
    - Collections filled with documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    - NoSQL, because there is no schema and you can add more data.
    - Horizontal scaling is nearly impossible.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - Relational Data needs to be merged manually.
