## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
    [Medium.com - What is functional programming?](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
    - Functional programming is a style of building  the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    [Medium.com - Pure functions](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
    - A pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    - Code is easier to test.

4. What is immutability?
    [Medium.com - Immutability](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
    - Once data has been created, it's state cannot be changed.

5. What is Referential transparency?
    [Medium.com - Referential transparency](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
    - If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent. ** pure functions + immutable data = referential  transparency **
