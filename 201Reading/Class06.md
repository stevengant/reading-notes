## JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    [MDN - Working with Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)
    A JavaScript object can be compared to a physical object: Objects have properties; eg: a cup has color, design, weight, material it is made of.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    [MDN - Object Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)
    The use of an Object Literal makes the transfer of a series of structured, related data more efficient, as one single object is being sent.

3. How do objects differ from arrays?
    [towardsdatascience - insertion](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-javascript-arrays-vs-objects-3c1f895907bd)
    Arrays have order; in order to insert data into an array, you would need to know the index. Objects do not keep track of order, so adding a property to the object would be much more simple.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
    [codeburst.io](https://codeburst.io/javascript-quickie-dot-notation-vs-bracket-notation-333641c0f781)
    Bracket notation allows you to use variables to access properties in an object.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term <this> refer to and what is the advantage to using <this>?
    [MDN - What is This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#what_is_this)
    The <this> tag refers to the current object (dog). The advantage of using the <this> tag is that when writing multiple object literals <this> enables you to use the same method definition for every object created - efficiency.



## Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM?
    [MDN - DOM Intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
    Document Object Model - Data representation of the objects that make up the structure and content of a web document. The DOM is a programming interface. It represents the document as nodes and objects so that programming languages can interact with the page.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
    [MDN - DOM and JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
    The DOM is accessed directly in JS by creating a <script>.
