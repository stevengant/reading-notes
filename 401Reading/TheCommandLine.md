## The Command Line Tasks

### The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.
[Linux Tutorial - So what are they exactly?](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)
    + A command line or terminal is a text-based interface that allows you to enter commands and receive text-based feedback.
    
    + Mac Users can open a terminal by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal -- or 'command+space'

    + Windows Users can open a terminal through the use of a SSH client or through WSL2

    + Linux Users can open a terminal by going Applications -> Utilities or Applications -> System

### Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.
[Linux Tutorial - So where are we?](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)
    + The pwd command (print working directory) tells you what your current working directory is
    
    + The ls command will list all the items in your current directory and can be combined with options to taylor the output to your needs

    + Absolute path refers to where the file is in relation to the root directory

    + Relative path refers to where the file is in relation to the current directory

### More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment
[Linux Tutorial - More About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)
    + Linux is an Extensionless System -- I actually never noticed that Linux didn't use file extensions (not that I have had that much experience with Linux). I find it interesting that Linux treats files and folders differently based on the file contents, rather than the file extensions

    + I find it interesting that Linux allows spaces in file names, but feel like that would just create a lot of problems  

### Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning
[Linux Tutorials - Manual Pages](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php)
    + Manual pages allow you to check the manual of a given command. Gives a description of the command and also lists options that can be used with the command

### File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories
[Linux Tutorials - File Manipulation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php)
    + The cp command allows you to copy a file. I didn't realize this was possible. I could have used this in my 301 class during project week due to a few gituations we had

    + Moving and renaming files/folders using the mv command would be extremely useful, but seems a bit complicated -- needs practice
