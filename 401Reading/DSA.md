# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
    - Depends on the data...You must consider what you are trying to do with the data structure  and try to choose the one that will most efficiently get the job done.


2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
    - By using a base case.
