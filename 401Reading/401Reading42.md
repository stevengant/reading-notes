2. The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of
  - This article particularly touched me. I have seen people close to me buy into questionable advertising on certain sites. As an employee of any company pushing questionable products or exaggerating a product's effectiveness it can be hard to speak up because that is your livelihood. As a developer, you could potentially be touching millions of lives with your work. Obviously, we have to be mindful of the code we are writing, and must be able to see the potential effects of our work. Hopefully, we would be in a "safe space" that would allow for calling this type of behavior out.

1. Self Driving Car Ethics
  - Self-driving cars are inevitable, as is AI. The biggest problem I see for the near-term to mid-term is that those self-driving cars are going to be on the road with human-driven cars (and greatly outnumbered by human-driven cars) and it is impossible to take every possibilty into account. I personally would not want to work on those teams that write the logic that chooses to potentially kill an innocent child to save a deer in the road or pedestrians on a crowded sidewalk in a busy intersection.
