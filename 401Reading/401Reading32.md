## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

**How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)**
- `useReducer` and `useContext` work together to simplify state management. `useReducer` allows us to manage complex state changes in a more controlled way, while `useContext` allows for sharing of state between components without having to pass around props.
Together, `useContext` and `useReducer` can simplify state management by providing a more centralized way to manage and share state. This streamlines the process of sharing and updating state.
