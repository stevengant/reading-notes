### Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

**How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)**

 `useReducer` and `useContext` work together to simplify state management. `useReducer` allows us to manage complex state changes in a more controlled way, while `useContext` allows for sharing of state between components without having to pass around props.

Used together, `useReducer` and `useContext` can simplify state management by providing a more predictable and centralized way to manage and share state. By using `useReducer` to manage state changes and `useContext` to share state between components, we can avoid prop drilling and make our code more maintainable and easier to reason about.
