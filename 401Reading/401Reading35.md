# Class 35 Reading

## Implementation: Graphs



### Graph Vocabulary/Definition List

1. `Vertex` - A vertex, or "node", is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices

2. `Edge` - An edge is a connection between two vertices

3. `Neighbor` - The neighbors of a vertex are its adjacent vertices

3. `Degree` - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it

4. `Undirected Graph` - A undirected graph is a graph where each edge is undireceted or b-directional. It does not have any direction

5. `Directed Graph` - A directed graph is a graph where every edge is directed

6. `Complete Graph` - A complete graph is a graph where all vertices are connected to all other vertices

7. `Connected Graph` - A connected graph is a graph where all vertices have at least one edge

8. `Disconnected Graph` - A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have any edges at all

9. `Acyclic Graph` - An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles
  - *a **cycle** is when a vertice or node can be traversed though and potentially end up back at itself*

10. `Cyclic Graph` - A cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles
  - *a **cycle** is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex*
