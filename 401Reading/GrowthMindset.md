# Prep Your Mindset

As an aspiring developer, I feel like the assigned material was aimed directly at me. I found myself actually assessing my mindset and interactions with people (including outside of Code Fellows).

I think [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice) and [Carol Dweck's TED Talk on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en) specifically apply to me in that I feel like I need to actually practice the material more and be okay with getting out of my comfort zone a little more.
