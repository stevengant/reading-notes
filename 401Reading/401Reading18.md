## AWS API Gateway Overview

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?
    [What is Amazon API Gateway?](https://www.serverless.com/guides/amazon-api-gateway)
    - Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
    - API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Serverless function directly in response to an HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups: it enables a truly serverless architecture for web applications. When using API Gateway together with other AWS services, itâ€™s possible to build a fully functional customer-facing web application without maintaining a single server yourself.

3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?
    - AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
    - AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
    - Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.
