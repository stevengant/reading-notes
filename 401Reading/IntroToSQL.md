A Relational Database is a database that is structured in a way that allows us to access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.
Data in a relational database is usually organized in tables.

A relational database can be administered through the use of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, SQL Server and SQLite.
